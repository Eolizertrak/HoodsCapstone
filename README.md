## Hassan Maskati
Hi, my name is Hassan Maskati and I am in my 3rd year studying Business-IT (AMK) at the Turku University of Applied Sciences. Throughout my studies I have become familiar with fundamentals in programming and web development technologies. My focus is to become a full stack web developer.

## Martin Lehtomaa
Im a 23 year old student in Turku University Of Applied Sciences and study Embedded software as and ICT Engineer. I also work part-time as a Software Developer at CGI. My interests are most in backend/server-side applications and embedded systems. I expect the course
to give a good base experience on real-life project work. I believe this specific project is going to be very interesting, because the main features to be implemented on the platform includes server-side systems for e.g. user registration and authentication.

My stregths are mostly in programming with Java and creating webapps. I am a very good team worker and a social guy social as well. My weakness is insecurity, for e.g. I might think too critically about my own work compared to other. This course gives a perfect opportunity to work on my weaknesses.

Previous work experience i have mostly on customer service and sales, but now I have worked almost 1 year as software developer. I have practical experience in programming through my own projects and school work.
