## Martin Lehtomaa
Im a 23 year old student in Turku University Of Applied Sciences and study Embedded software as and ICT Engineer. I also work part-time as a Software Developer at CGI. My interests are most in backend/server-side applications and embedded systems. I expect the course
to give a good base experience on real-life project work. I believe this specific project is going to be very interesting, because the main features to be implemented on the platform includes server-side systems for e.g. user registration and authentication.

My stregths are mostly in programming with Java and creating webapps. I am a very good team worker and a social guy social as well. My weakness is insecurity, for e.g. I might think too critically about my own work compared to other. This course gives a perfect opportunity to work on my weaknesses.

Previous work experience i have mostly on customer service and sales, but now I have worked almost 1 year as software developer. I have practical experience in programming through my own projects and school work.

## Outcome of PO Meeting
The meeting with the product owners of Know Your Hoods was held on 8/11/2019 with member participants attending in person or through Skype. The meeting began with all participants introducing themselves. The main agenda for the meeting was to get an introduction of the product and owners and a general idea of our next tasks in development. The main features that the PO was interested in developing for the hoods.fi website was an authentication feature for user logins and importantly, a way to activate the users into the platform and get them to engage with the application. 

A summary of the product and company will be provided to the project members. This will also include material or notes for the pitch.

We decided on a date for a brainstorming session with the PO to get into details about the technical-side of development. We also decided on the most appropriate times for meetings with the owners.

Communication between the project members and PO will be through Slack and Google Drive.

## Research Summary
Interesting concepts relating to discovering neighbourhoods:
- discover.com had an article of a guide about researching neighbourhoods before moving to one. The guide pointed out that research should be done about pricing, taxes and services. The site provides well-tailored search options that match those exact features.

- Trulia is focused on providing their customers with relevant information about neighborhoods and opinions of the residents. Trulia isn’t the only one, there is also Nextdoor which is more like a social network where people from the neighborhood can share events and ideas. That is something that could be implemented in the Know Your Hoods project when the authentication has been created. Based on what we found it seems that neighborhood search is more popular in United States than in other countries. Sites like Neighborhoodscout, Neighborhoods and Areavibes show the searcher things like Demographics, incomes, services and crime rates of the neighborhoods. Those sites try to recommend you a neighborhood based on your search criteria. That is exactly what Know Your Hoods is currently doing in Finland.

- Utu.fi has an article about Know Your Hoods and it talks about the origins of the company, Choose Your Future and their products. It talks about the usefulnesss of using open data sets to provide services to the public.
